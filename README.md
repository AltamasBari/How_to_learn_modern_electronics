# How to learn modern electronics
**A guide to the adventurer**<br>
First of all basic electronics can be simple to understand, but to understand it deeply and see were the rabbit hole goes you have to do some serious kind of study. The plan to enlightenment has multiple parallel path’s, but books, internet info, youtube video channels and good forums constitute the main pillars.<br>
<br>

## Books
I’m suggesting that you read the books from cover to cover and not only for reference.<br>
<br>
The first book that you should read is a cheap book but a very good one.<br>
<br>

Pag. 1050 <br>
<br>
Now that you know a little bit about what electronics is in the majority of the fields that are connected to electronic circuits, you should try to delve a little deeper in each subject.<br>
